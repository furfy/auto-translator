Translation **Framework** for **RuneLite** that can translate *ACTUALLY* everything[^1]!
**Original Text** and **UI** are untouched to prevent confusion of misleading translations.
Support for any type of language characters[^2], including **Japanese**, **Chinese** and many others.
Embedded **H2 SQL** database[^3] with an organized schema for the supported languages and offline translations.

- [x] Translation for **NPC**, **Player** and other dialogs.
- [x] Translation for **Game Messages** and **Examines**.
- [x] Translation for **NPC** and **Item**[^4] names.
- [x] Translation for **Dialog Options**.
- [x] Translation for **Overhead Text**.
- [x] Translation[^5] for **Scrolls**, **Books**, **Player Messages** and any other text on the screen.

[^1]: Not interaction **Menus**, not **Stats**, not other basic **UI** elements.
[^2]: You have to provide your own font via the config.
[^3]: Translation via `Select Text` won't be saved into the database, only temporarily.
[^4]: Only when you click **Examine**.
[^5]: Available only via context menu of the **Quick Actions** button.

## Guide for DeepL

> [!NOTE]
> **DeepL API Key** is _REQUIRED_ for this to work.

- You have to register **DeepL Account** and subscribe for *free* or *paid* **Developer's API**, copy your **API Key** from this [page](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account/summary).
	- If you can't register or verify for any reason ‚Äì ask someone to help you!
- Open the config and paste the key into the **API Key** field, type in your destination **Language** and choose whatever you want to be translated in the **Translation** section!
	- [List](src/main/resources/languages.json) of <span title="Last updated on February 6 Year 2024"><ins>supported languages</ins></span>!
	- Be warned that any additional stuff will use your **API Quota**, so choose wisely.
- **H2 SQL** database is located at `.runelite/cache/polywoof.mv.db` path.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to choose the right plan, **__DeepL API Free__** or **API __Pro__**, not ~~_DeepL Starter_~~, ~~_Advanced_~~ or ~~_Ultimate_~~!

## Frequently Asked Questions

- _Not working at all, nothing appears, nothing works._
