## Guide for DeepL

> [!NOTE]
> **DeepL API Key** is **REQUIRED** for this to work.

- You have to register **DeepL Account** and subscribe for *free* or *paid* **Developer's API**, then you have to copy your **API Key** from this [page](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account/summary).
	- If you can't register or verify for any reason ‚Äì ask someone to help you out!
- Open plugin config and paste it into the **API Key** field, type in your destination **Language** and choose whatever you want to be translated in the **Translation** section!
	- [List](src/main/resources/languages.json) of <span title="Last updated on February 6 Year 2024"><ins>available languages</ins></span>!
	- Be warned that any additional stuff will use your **API Quota**, so choose wisely.
- **H2 SQL** database is located under `.runelite/cache/polywoof.mv.db` with saved translations.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to choose the right plan, **__DeepL API Free__** or **API __Pro__**, not **~~DeepL Starter~~**, **~~Advanced~~** or **~~Ultimate~~**!

## Frequently Asked Questions

- _Not working at all, nothing appears, nothing works._
  - You didn't put the required **API Key** in the config, or got the wrong one.

- _**DeepL** is not working in my country, what should I do?_
  - I pointed out in the **Guide**, you should ask your friends for help.
- _What happens when **API Quota** is all used?_
	- Nothing horrible, but you have to wait till the ending of the month.
- _I've put everything in the config, but it's still translating to **English**._
  - You selected the wrong backend in the config, **Generic** backend is for debugging purposes only.

	- I've tried my best to make the code expandable, feel free to **contribute**.

	- Absolutely, you have to copy mentioned **H2 SQL** file to the **same directory** on another computer.
